# Slowmode Counter

A powercord plugin that will show you your slowmode even if you're immune. Doesn't block you from sending messages.

Known Bug: The first second of slowmode seems to skip and is half as long as a second. Not sure why it's happening.

Big thanks to Strencher.

Made for [suggestion #504](https://github.com/powercord-community/suggestions/issues/504)
